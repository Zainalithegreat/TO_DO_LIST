This project is a feature-rich to-do list application designed to provide a seamless and interactive task management experience.
The application offers the following key features:

Drag-and-Drop Functionality:

      Users can easily organize their tasks by dragging and dropping items between 
      different containers or categories, such as "Start," "In Progress," and "Completed."
  
Persistent Task Storage:

      All tasks are securely stored in a database, ensuring that users' data 
      remains available even after logging out or switching devices.
      
Multi-User Support:

      The application is designed to handle multiple users, allowing each 
      user to manage their own personalized task list.
      User authentication ensures that each user's data is private and secure.
      
Dynamic Updates:

      Tasks can be added, updated, or deleted in real-time, with changes 
      reflected in the database to maintain consistency.
      
Modern UI/UX:

      The user interface is designed with a focus on user-friendliness, 
      ensuring an intuitive experience that makes it effortless for users 
      to navigate the application and create customized to-do lists.
      
Backend Functionality:

      The server-side logic is implemented to handle task creation, updates, 
      and deletion efficiently. Tasks are uniquely identified 
      using database-generated IDs, ensuring data integrity.
